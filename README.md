# 4th order Runge Kutta implementation in MATLAB
The repository contains MATLAB implementation of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to simulate a trajectory of points from the Lorenz system of differential equations.

The primary reference for the code and theory is the [lecture video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOWJp8NV5xU&t=195s) by Steve Brunton.
